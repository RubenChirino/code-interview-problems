// Question
// Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle 
// (i.e any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) 
// of a linked list, given the head of the linked list.

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteMiddle(ListNode head) {
        // Edge cases
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return null;
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head.next.next;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        // At this point, we have the node before the middle
        slow.next = slow.next.next; // So we skip the middle node
        return head;
    }
}

// Tests:

/* 
Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node.  
*/

/*
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
*/

/*
Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.
